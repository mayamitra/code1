//NOTES ON MODULO:
// if(i % 3 )==0, % called MODULO and gives you the reaminder, 
// so this will give you multiples of 3 as i, becuase their remainder will be 0.
//frameCount % 30 == 0, conditional that only does something every 30 frames

//PROBABILITY: things will happen 25% of the time whe you include this
//float r;
//r = (0, 1);
//if (r>.75); OR if(r<.25)

// (r<.25)
//index = 0
//(r >=.25 && r<.50)
//index = 1
